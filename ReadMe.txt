Welcome dear visitor,
The next project is a screen builder project which was created using Html, Javascript, Css.
This is a Javascript project that executes commands that the user selects and designs the elements on the main page of the screen builder, and all this with the help of an accessible and intuitive design for the user.
The project contains functions that build elements according to user request.
I hope you will be impressed by my project and with any questions do not hesitate to contact me through my portfolio website.git
